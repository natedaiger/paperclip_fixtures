Hi

This is, as of now, a very dirty, hackish implementation of something like attachment_fu_fixtures for Thoughtbot's Paperclip plugin.

If for some reason you came across this, you probably shouldn't use it unless you're willing to basically write it yourself. I just needed this for a hackish project so I put little time into it.

Inspiration and code from:
