Hi.

This does for Paperclip what attachment_fu_fixtures did for attachment_fu.

Example:

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_attached_file :attractive_photo
    has_attached_file :unattractive_photo
  end

You could do a fixture like this:

  frank:
    name: Frank Stallone
    file_for_attractive_photo: /home/frank/looking_good.jpg
    file_for_unattractive_photo: /home/frank/oh_tonight_got_kind_of_weird.jpg
    
There you go!

Inspiration and some code code from:
